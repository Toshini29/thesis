# KRAFT – A Knowledge-Graph-Based Resource Allocation Framework
This repository contains the code for the paper of same name. Please refer to the paper for conceptual details.

The code in this repository implements an approach to resource allocation in business processes based on knowledge graph. The allocator is tied into the [Business Process Optimization Competition 2023 (BPOC)](https://sites.google.com/view/bpo2023/competition) simulation frame for resource allocation. The main entry point is the [Demonstration](./Demonstration.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites & Setup
This project uses Python 3.10. The version is necessary for compatibility with the simulator frame. 

First, clone this repository and navigate into the project folder.
This repository additionally utilizes the Business Process Optimization Competition 2023 simulation frame. Please download the respective zip file from the official [BPOC 2023 website](https://sites.google.com/view/bpo2023/competition) and unpack it as subfolder of the cloned project folder.

We strongly recommend the usage of a virtual environment, e.g., with
``` bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

Then, please install the necessary Python libraries:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_bpoc.txt
```

You can from now on start the Jupyter notebook by running the following:
``` bash
jupyter lab
```


## Known Issues
- The simulator might get stuck by only appropriating resources that cannot run the currently open tasks. In that case, just rerun the simulation
